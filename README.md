This game in development will soon be a tower defense made from only DOM, HTML, CSS, and SVG.



I am putting my coding skills to the test by making this huge projects.



Here are some things that will be added into the game:



•Audio

•Multiple maps and levels

•Hundreds of different towers

•automatic local storage

•And HOURS of fun




This game will be done in approx three months.  It's going to take a while to finish this.

UPDATE LOG:

•Finished drawing all of the towers, 47 in total
