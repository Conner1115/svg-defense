This game in development will soon be a tower defense made from only DOM, HTML, CSS, and SVG.

I am putting my coding skills to the test by making this huge projects.

Here are some things that will be added into the game
•Audio
•Multiple maps and levels
•Hundreds of different towers
•And HOURS of fun

This game will be done in approx. Three months.  It's going to take a while to finish this.
