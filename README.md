This game in development will soon be a tower defense made from only DOM, HTML, CSS, and SVG.



I am putting my coding skills to the test by making this huge project.



Here are some things that will be added into the game:



•Audio

•Multiple maps and levels

•Hundreds of different towers

•automatic local storage

•And HOURS of fun




This game will be done in approx three months.  It's going to take a while to finish this.

UPDATE LOG:

•Finished drawing all of the towers, 47 in total

•Finished the enemy graphics

•Finished tower, enemy, and bullet mechanics

•I was forced to use processing.js and canvas to animate the game
